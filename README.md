## What is the Dizzy AU?

The Dizzy AU is a Sonic AU, where the only conflict around is the conflict of absolute boredom.

It's a slice-of-life "RP" story ran by MeowcaTheoRange. 
It's not very interesting, only bringing low-lit grammar and barely any newlines.

## Where's the story??

Any story format that'll interest you as a **casual reader** would probably be in `story/human-readable/` or `story/human-readable.md`.

You can also read the story, properly formatted on the [Pages build](https://meowcatheorange.github.io/Dizzy-AU/index).

Any story format that'll interest you as a **developer** or an avid **REST user** would definitely be in `story/database.json`. This is only for automatic human-readable creation and API usage. 
Feel free to use the story's JSON file as a source for an API, just **credit the repository** of the Dizzy AU somewhere in your project.

## Developers

Developers can refer to the [API help guide](https://github.com/MeowcaTheoRange/Dizzy-AU/blob/main/help/api-guide.md) to assist them.

This guide is for the file [database.json](https://github.com/MeowcaTheoRange/Dizzy-AU/blob/main/story/database.json) and how it is formatted to be interpreted by APIs.

The built in [Converter file](https://github.com/MeowcaTheoRange/Dizzy-AU/blob/main/code/converter.js) can serve as a reference, as it converts the JSON format to multiple MD files.

You can also use [template.md](https://github.com/MeowcaTheoRange/Dizzy-AU/blob/main/story/human-readable/template.md) and [the template line](https://github.com/MeowcaTheoRange/Dizzy-AU/blob/4f008e60240881f853853abcbb273c1de2266fbf/story/database.json#L1374) of database.json to see how the data is processed.

## Main Characters:

### Miles Prower
- Aged 19, male he/him
- Homosexual

Species: Mobian - Fox

Likes: Chili dogs, and sleeping a LOT

dislikes: Having to get up and do stuff '-v-

Weight: 140lbs

Height: 5'0

Friends: [Silver Blure](#Silver-Blure)

Abilities/Powers: He has two tails, but they're... smaller than the original's, so he can't fly, sadly.

Weaknesses: He sleeps. A Lot.

Gadgets: Like, one. He's still smart enough to invent, and as a child, he did. But now he's burnt out, and he's lost all of his inventions in a previous house fire. So... he only invents if he truly *has* to.

Personality:  Lazy, homo, and very chill.

Where they stay or live: His house. It's a *very* small apartment. He has a couch, a TV, a kitchen, and a bedroom. Good enough for living!

Back Story: A future AU of Tails, who, after many years of creating, got burnt out and became an adult. 
He's tired, and he had kind of a stable job in ***RETAIL*** üò®üò®üò®.
He currently lives in a small apartment, because it fits him and his uses well. 
It even came with a small garage, obviously joined with other garages, but it's a great place to have a workspace... someday.
He imagines a day he gets out of his dead-end unemployment status, and into a career of inventions.
He's dreamed for his past revolutions to make rounds and at least generate some income from it. 
But his previous place (his parents' house) caught fire, and all of his hard work as a small boy had turned to ash.

### Silver Blure
- Aged -117 (23, from 200 years in the future), male he/him
- Bisexual

Species: Mobian - Hedgehog

Likes: Doing __nothing__, mostly.

Dislikes: 

Weight: 120lbs

Height: 5'5

Friends: [Miles Prower](#Miles-Prower)

Abilities/Powers: Psychokinesis. Maybe *__teleportation__??*

Weaknesses: 

Gadgets: One, given by Miles. It's a spatula. That spins.

Weapons: The spatula.

Personality: Very outgoing and friendly. When he needs to be, though, he's commanding and can communicate well to those he manages.

Where they stay or live: A very well-kept house. With a cat! Her name is Jan.

Description: Silver. Y'know, that hedgehog from 200 years in the future. 
Well, in the Dizzy AU, nothing *ever* happens. 
Because conflict doesn't really exist. Because of that, in future Mobius, everyone has done everything, ever.
So life, despite being a luxury, since there's nothing urgent to do, there's nothing _good_ to do, either. Nobody really has anything to do. 
So Silver went back 200 years into the past to actually find something to do. 
Of course, nothing unique is in the past, but here, Mobius is a lot less advanced, and that means there are things to do! Woo, great job.
