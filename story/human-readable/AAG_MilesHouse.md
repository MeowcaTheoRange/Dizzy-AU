### Miles Prower

> *Today, right now, it seems Miles is on the phone. He's making a call to Silver.* "Hey, Silver. You there?"

### Silver Blure

> "yeah, I am. Do you need something? Is this about your old job-?"

### Miles Prower

> "No, no, not at all. It's not about the job. It's about *us.* Would... you mind coming over later this afternoon?"

### Silver Blure

> "...er... yeah, why not. I get off at six, then I should be good to go. What is it, by the way?"

### Miles Prower

> "I'd rather not say over the phone, heh- you know how I get on this thing with private information."

### Silver Blure

> "Oh. Oh, OK. Uhh, is it... important-? Because... if it is, I can probably get Kevin to cover my managerial shift."

### Miles Prower

> "No, no, it's not too important, you can keep on working. I'm fine with seeing you after six."

### Silver Blure

> "...ookay. See you after six, then?"

### Miles Prower

> "Yup, see you then."

### Silver Blure

> "Nice. OK. *Adieu, Miles!*"

### Miles Prower

> "U...uh-huh... adieu." *click*

    -- Later --

### Miles Prower

> *A knock is heard on the door. Miles gets up, checking the time. It's about 6:30. Miles unlocks the door, seeing Silver behind it.*

> "Oh- uh, hey, Silver- you're here."

### Silver Blure

> "I'm here, haha-" *Silver bear-hugs Miles.* "So... what's up?"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles is a bit shocked with the hug, but he tries to keep his composure nonetheless.* "Erm- would you mind... sitting down for this?" *Miles says, closing the door and locking it, before heading to the couch to sit. His heart pounds, and tensions are quite high.*

### Silver Blure

> "Er... it's.no problem at all." *Silver sits down at the couch. They share a tense moment of silence, as Miles' awkwardness keeps him at bay.*

> "So... uh. *ahem*. What is it you want to tell me?"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles continues to sit in silence. Pressure is building.*

### Silver Blure

> "...Miles? Are you there?" *Silver waves a hand in front of Miles' face.*

### Miles Prower

> "I'm so sorry-" *Miles replies, burying his face.* "god damn it, I should have prepared for this better-"

### Silver Blure

> "...uh-"

### Miles Prower

> "...Silver, you, uh... you know the stuff we've been doing since we... first met?" *Miles quietly says. Silver leans in to hear.* "Y'know... the gay stuff-?"

### Silver Blure

> "Erm... uh-huh, yeah."

### Miles Prower

> *Miles falls into dead silence again. Silver sighs, trying to guess.*

### Silver Blure

> "Miles... are you trying to say you like me or somethin'? I've never seen you get this... red-faced."

> *Silver pats Miles' back, tilting up his head.*

### Miles Prower

> "...uh... hhh..." *Miles' heart pounds. He looks up at Silver, directly in his eyes. That damn sincere look of his... shit, he truly actually cares. Miles slowly guides into a hug, breaking into tears.* "...yeah- i'll be honest, I've liked you this whole time-"

### Silver Blure

> "oh, my God- I... I knew it this whole time, but I didn't know if it was a joke or not- Miles, you're cute, and you're a good guy... right,"

> *Silver thinks.* "And... and I'll be honest, you haven't been all secret with being gay for me. I've had my theories, but here you are." *Silver smiles, tilting up Miles' head again.* "I like you too, dude. Of course I would. You're the sweetest guy I know. You might have your flaws, but christ you're just so lovable. So... the feelings are mutual, Miles."

### Miles Prower

> *Miles looks up at Silver, tears in his eyes.* "...mutual... wow... I don't know how to feel- honestly, I thought I would just fall on my back with this... but mutual feelings."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver pats Miles on the head, while Miles pulls them both into a hug. A hug that marks an event for the ages.*
