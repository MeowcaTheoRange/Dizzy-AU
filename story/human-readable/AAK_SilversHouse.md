### Silver's Cat'

> *Silver and Miles are both sleeping in Silver's bed. They're cuddling, and Miles is snoring loudly. Silver's cat does not like this snoring.*

> *She jumps up on the bed, strutting to Miles, beginning to swat as his face.*

> *Miles' snoring slowly stops as Silver's cat lands a final blow on his nose.*

### Miles Prower

> "the huh- OH my god-" *Miles jumps back to the head of the bed, causing Silver's cat to jump off and run away.*

### Silver Blure

> *Silver wakes up in sequence, but actually because, you know, Miles yelped in fear.* "agh- what's the matter-"

### Miles Prower

> "Silver... do you have a cat? You never told me you had a cat."

### Silver Blure

> "oh, yeah, i'm sorry. yeah, I have a cat... her name is jan. why do you ask..?"

### Miles Prower

> "Because... well, I may have just been repeatedly attacked by her."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver quietly chuckles.* "hehe- Nice. she's like that sometimes."

### Miles Prower

> "Man, I want a cat... I relate too hard with them."

### Silver Blure

> "you know, if you want, you could babysit jan. i'm gone for most of the day without her, so it would be great to have someone to watch her."

### Miles Prower

> "I mean, sure... but are you sure? My apartment's small, and your house is... well, it's relatively big. Cats love running around, right?"

### Silver Blure

> "i never said it would be at your place. you can stay over here and watch her."

### Miles Prower

> "Oh. Well... yeah, why not? Do I get snacks?"

### Silver Blure

> "anything in the kitchen. except the cake, that is for a work party."

### Miles Prower

> "Yeah, I'm in. When do I start-?"

### Silver Blure

> "uhh... i guess when I leave for work?"

### Miles Prower

> "...OK."

### ---

> *Silence comes over the room for a few seconds. There's a train system quite distant from Silver's house, and it can be heard passing by.*

### Silver Blure

> "...i'm gonna go back to sleep, Miles. Goodnight."

### Miles Prower

> "Alright, goodnight."

### ---

> *They both get under the covers, as they were. Dozing off to sleep for the next day... or when Jan swats Miles' face again.*
