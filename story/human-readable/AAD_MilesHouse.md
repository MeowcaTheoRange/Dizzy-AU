# Miles' House
- Silver Blure
- Miles Prower

### Silver Blure

> *...Silver appears out of nowhere after a... very long while, waving to Miles...*

> *...he's passed out on the couch. It's night-time already.*

> "oh. Maybe I took a bit too long refining my teleportation."

> *Silver sits down next to Miles, patting his head softly.*

### Miles Prower

> "hhfgh- what- who's there??" *Miles wakes up after being pat, looking around. His blanket is over his face.*

### Silver Blure

> "Oh-! Sorry, I woke you up. I just got here."

### Miles Prower

> "...uh-huh... uhh... how long has it been since you've last messaged me?"

### Silver Blure

> "Oh, uhh... 22 hours. It's been a... whole day- hah-"

### Miles Prower

> "mm. maybe you should have walked." *Miles silently remarks, curling back up, resting in Silver's lap.*

### Silver Blure

> "...ah-" *Silver reacts as Diz rests his head on his lap... but he gets used to it.* "...uhh, yeah, I should've. is it OK if I stay over for the night?" *Silver asks, modestly petting Miles as he slowly goes back to sleep.*

### Miles Prower

> "yeah, whatever's left of it. we can hang out... later today."

### Silver Blure

> "Sounds good... nighty-night."

### Miles Prower

> *Miles reaches for the TV remote, located on the coffee table nearby. He grabs it, turning the TV on and muting the volume.* "here you go. you can watch some tv if you want."

### Silver Blure

> "thanks, Miles." *Silver smiles, taking the TV remote. He turns the TV off and simply sleeps with Diz until the next day.*
