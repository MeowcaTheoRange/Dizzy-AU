### Miles Prower

> *It's been 2 days. Silver's left, in order to go to work. Miles is alone, watching TV again. He sighs, thinking of Silver... what a cool little guy. It's midnight, and Miles is still up despite how late it is. His sleep schedule is gruesomely messed up...*

> *He's watching romance comedies. Rom-coms. The real saucy ones. He's watching the characters' dynamics closely, thinking if him and Silver match any singly one of them...*

> *Miles feels a bit lonely without Silver, though. It's like his only motivation is that cool little hedgehog. But alas, Silver's not here to keep him company... and Miles doesn't have his job anymore, due to "the incident". He's here, living off of unemployment, and hoping to God he doesn't die before he's finally able to do something about his work status.*

> *In the rom-com, there's a nice couple Miles has been focused on for the longest time. The woman's name: Marissa. The man's name?* ***Miles.*** *He's been focused on the two since the first episode. Miles ticks all of the boxes for himself... lazy, fat (at least, for Mobian standards), and kind of awkward. Miles is a guy who's desperate for anything life has to give him, and maybe Marissa could be the thing he's been begging for. Marissa, she reflects Silver nicely as well. She's timid, and kind of the submissive type, but she'd definitely tell Miles to get up and go take an opportunity if he was about to miss one. Miles and Marissa don't live together, but their love is regardless of distance.*

> *Miles (Tails) has been trying to find answers from the show, to some avail. He's been thinking about his sexuality, and where he's at. Is he truly in* ***love*** *with Silver? Or is this just a silly friendship thing? He's been trying to piece together this puzzle of himself ever since he started watching... if he actually loves Silver the way Show Miles loves Marissa.*

> *But who knows... it could be a whole dumb thing. Just another plant in the farm of friendship. Love is dumb, and Miles (Tails) is very knowing of the fact that it's stupid. But with Silver, it's not dumb...*

> *...it's just complicated.*
