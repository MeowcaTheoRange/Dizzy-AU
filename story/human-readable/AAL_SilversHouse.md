### Miles Prower

> *Miles wakes up, later than* **ever**. *It seems he overslept.*

> *He looks to where Silver was in the bed. He's gone. So, Miles stretches and checks his phone.*

> *He has a text from Silver, which is a list of all of the things he has to do for Jan.*

### Silver Blure

> "Heya, Miles! I noticed you overslept, so I'd figure that I could just text you what I would need you to do with my cat.

> You should definitely feed her. She gets... really angry without her food, as most cats do. She's probably already meowing at you from the foot of the bed right now.

> I've checked her litter for you, so that shouldn't be a thing you have to do.

> Also, you should definitely absolutely pet her every once in a while. It'll be easy, because she'll yell at you when the time comes.

> Alright, love you, Miles. See you after work! :]"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles gets up out of bed to feed Silver's cat. He sees her, looking up at him with a tilted head.*

> *She then walks up to him, meowing repeatedly, with the softest but most bossy meow you've ever heard.*

> "...this cat." *he says, almost regretfully.* "Do you want some food? Is that what you want?"

### Silver's Cat

> *Silver's cat meows, then walks out of the room through the silver of open door.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles follows her, looking to see what feeds that damn cat. It's pretty obvious though, because it's the box of wet cat food right next to her food bowl.*

> *He opens the box, seeing what seems like a billion cans of cat food. He grabs one off of the top, trying his best to open the can.*

> "Here you go, cat." *Miles remarks to the cat, who continues to meow at him, even swatting at his face with her paw.*

> *Miles dumps out the contents of the can onto the plate. He then looks at the empty can and wonders where the hell the residue goes.*

> *He looks around for the recycling bin- hell, even a trash can, trying to find some kind of thing to put the can in.*

> *After a long while, he finally finds the recycling bin marked with tape on its cupboard. Miles opens up the cupboard, throwing the can into the bin. He sighs, finally able to take a small break.

> *Miles lies on the couch, able to just doze off until Jan needs him.*
