### Miles Prower

> *Miles wakes up to his phone ringing. He stretches, itching his head.* "who the hell..." *He looks to his phone, which displays the name "Silver".*

> "...oh, it's Silver." *Miles sighs, grabbing the phone and picking up the call.*

> "Miles here, what d'ya need?"

### Silver Blure

> "Oh, hi- I was just checking on you since yesterday. You OK?"

### Miles Prower

> "...how much times have you tried to call me?"

### Silver Blure

> "...Ten times."

### Miles Prower

> "ok... well, I just woke up, so calm yourself. I would definitely have called you when I actually woke up. Anyway, I'm fine. You can stop calling..."

### Silver Blure

> "Allright, I will. 'cause at least you picked up. Have a nice day, Miles."

### Miles Prower

> "...I won't forget to..." *Miles hangs up, setting down the phone, sitting up, and rubbing his eyes.*
