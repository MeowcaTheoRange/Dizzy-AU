> *Silver and Miles are sitting at a table, next to each other. They both have vanilla cups with sprinkles and Generic Name Brand Cinnamon Squares atop the mounds of cold. They're having a chat about love and... relationships.*

### Silver Blure

> "So like... how *do* you like being treated in a relationship-?"

### Miles Prower

> "uhh... i'm not sure. just... uhh. don't be a jerk? i guess?"

### Silver Blure

> "Of course, dude. No matter what, I'll let ya keep yer dignity."

### Miles Prower

> "thanks, Silv... y'know, you're a really great dude. that makes me happy."

### Silver Blure

> "Aww... Ditto, Miles. I like you cus you're just so sweet."

### Miles Prower

> "hah- okay, then. love you too, man."

> *Silver and Miles look at each other. Miles gets flustered, looking directly into Silver's eyes. He looks away, blushing profusely. Silver takes notice, chuckling a little as he pats Miles' head.*

### Silver Blure

> *Silver sighs.* "D'ya wanna take this to my house? It's not too far."

### Miles Prower

> "of course it's not too far, you live in the most urban place I know."

### Silver Blure

> "Haha... yeah."

> *They both get up, taking their ice cream with them on the road. They exit the shop, heading almost immediately in the direction of Silver's house.*
