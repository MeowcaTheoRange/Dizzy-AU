### Miles Prower


> *Diz is sleeping on his couch again. He's been doing this since the day he got his first place. It saves space, but it gives him headaches the day after... Oh well. His TV is idling, using that bouncing screensaver with the TV logo on it. It's been like this for 14 hours, 15 minutes after he fell asleep. Other than that, everything's completely normal...*

### ---


> *A knock is heard on the door, followed by what seems like feet shuffling away from the door.*

> *The buzzer rings shortly after the steps are heard departing, which wakes Miles up.*

### Miles Prower


> "gah- mmh- in a MINUTE!" *he shouts across the room, crawling out of bed and up to let whatever's out there in.* "and this late, too... what happened to calling first."

> *...After a while, nobody's appeared at the door, so he goes to check out in the hallway.*

> *It's a package, adressed to little ol' Diz himself.* "Oh, my package. I've been waiting for this..." *he says, nabbing the package and shutting the door behind him.* "...wonder which order it is." *He grabs a nearby knife... stopping after he picks it up. He observes it... there's a little bit of blood on the edge.* "...oh. right. Wrong knife." *He takes a detour into his kitchen, to get another, cleaner knife. Then, he cuts the tape with said knife, opening up the box.*

> *It's a box of donuts, with a note on top of it. The address line says "Miles Prower, 14th b." and the return address reads "Silver". Upon seeing the note, he smirks.* "Well, this isn't my order, that's for sure. And it's from Silver... this'll be somethin'." *Miles takes the box with him into the living room/bedroom, taking out the box of donuts, throwing the package container behind the couch, and detaching the note from the donuts.*

> *He opens up the note, reading it.*

### Silver's Letter


> 

> "*Hey, Tails, I sincerely hope you're really alive and well while reading this. This box of donuts is for you, sir. I'm so thankful you've been found alive. Your willingness to end it all was truly depressing to hear... if only I could have helped you more during those times. I hope you're doing better right now, seriously. So, I got you these donuts, and I've messaged your phone... if you're even still on it... an offer if you wanted to come over and hang out sometime so hopefully, we can... talk it out. It's so nice to have you back, I seriously thought you'd be gone for good... Please get back to me any way you can, no matter the method. And if you can't... well, so be it. At least this message reached you well, if you're reading this.*

> 

> *Your dearest manager and friend,*

> *- Silver*"

> 

> *Miles sits back, smiling.* "...okay, wow- maybe I should text him. He clearly does miss me." *He opens the donut box, taking out a donut and biting it.*

> *Tails then takes out his phone, one-handed messaging Silver back.*

> 

> "*silv hey im alive and im eating one of your donuts hahah*"

### Silver Blure


> "Oh my god Miles you really are alive"

> 

> "Or wait are you"

> 

> "Please tell me this is real. video call me right now. "

### Miles Prower


> "*yeah yeah calm your ass silver im figuring that shit out*"

> 

> "*how do i video call on this godforsaken thing ffs*"

### Silver Blure


> "Theres a button on the top left click that it will ask you what. you want to use click FaceTime"

### Miles Prower


> "*which button on the left. the box one?*"

### Silver Blure


> "What"

### Miles Prower


> "*the box one. the one that looks like a box with a beam of light shooting out of it*"

### Silver Blure


> "Yesthat one"

### Miles Prower


> "*ok*"

    -- Later --

> *Diz sighs, standing up and setting the donuts on the kitchen counter. He then collapses back on the couch, really tired.*

> 

> *Overall, tonight was great. Diz got some donuts, he had someone truly care for him in what felt like... months... and he got to see his job manager and super close friend, Silver again.*

> *Miles and Silver were very close friends. Before the incident, Miles had a huge crush on Silver when they were hanging out. On the job, their closeness was kept more on the down-low. But Miles truly had feelings for Silver... but his other feelings were more powerful, resulting in the incident that we all know.*

> 

> *Now, Miles feels slight comfort near Silver, although.. not really anything more than cool friendliness... but to regain that love for Silver, they'd need to be around each other once again. That will happen soon enough...*

> *Diz eventually falls back asleep, smiling while doing so... Thinking about how someone truly cared for him when he was struggling warmed him inside.*
