# Silver's House
- Miles Prower
- Silver Blure

### Miles Prower

> "...how come i've never been to your house in the years we've known each other?"

### Silver Blure

> "You were too busy workin' after six to come with. I would've been happy to show you around, but it's fine."

### Miles Prower

> "ah, those days. remember when i worked for you instead of dating you?"

### Silver Blure

> "I recall you were still gay back then, too?"

### Miles Prower

> "i've always been gay. it's... just a part of me. i've always liked boys... them and their nice bodies... and they can be so sweet but rugged sometimes..."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver raises an eyebrow.* "...Like who?"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles looks directly at Silver, with no hesitation.* "You know *exactly* who, Silv." *Miles comes closer to Silver.* "c'mon... nice bod, sweet personality..."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver gets a bit flustered, put in an awkward situation with Miles' distance. He tries not to freak out, though.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles sighs.* "you're perfect. and ripe for loving!"

### Silver Blure

> *Silver smiles, calming down a bit.* "...ah- well, thank you Miles-"

### Miles Prower

> "no need. it just comes pre-packaged, right?"

### Silver Blure

> *Silver buries his face in his hands, mostly in embarrassment.* "oh my God- you smooth asshole--"

### Miles Prower

> "hah- anyway, do you have any tv in here?"

### Silver Blure

> "Uhh, yeah. it's in the living room! May I show you?"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles nods.* "lead the way, silv."

### ---

> *Miles and Silver sit down on the couch, cuddling close. Silver passes the remote to Miles, who turns on the TV and looks towards Silver.*

### Miles Prower

> "hey, what do you wanna watch-?"

### Silver Blure

> "Uh, I dunno. You're the guest, man."

### Miles Prower

> *Miles sighs, a bit tired, like always.* "...well, OK. i've been watching this one show, it's a, uh, romance comedy. it's called 'stupid love'. have you ever heard of it?"

### Silver Blure

> "Uh, no, I haven't. Is it good?"

### Miles Prower

> "It was good enough to make me confess my love to you, Silv. It's... definitely relatable."

### Silver Blure

> "Oh! Wait, really? No way."

### Miles Prower

> *Miles shakes his head.* "yes way. it's why we're here, now. it's also why I can do..."

### Silver Blure

> "do what--"

### Miles Prower

> *Miles lifts himself up to face level with Silver, wrapping his arms around Silv.* "this."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver gets REALLY flustered, but allows it to happen. He gets close to Miles, holding his sides and straight-up kissing him. They peck for a small bit, before Silver deems it a bit too embarrassing and pulls back, covering his face.*

### Miles Prower

> "...uh- Silver-?"

### Silver Blure

> "oh my God oh myGodohmygod- Miiiiiles-"

### Miles Prower

> "...was it good?"

### Silver Blure

> *Silver nods furiously, still looking away from Miles.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles smiles slightly, hugging Silver.*
