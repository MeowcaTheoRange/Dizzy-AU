# Miles' House

    -- December --

### Miles Prower

> It is 8am, and Miles is sleeping on his couch, dreaming about his career.

> The re-discovery of the Miles Electric dances across his brain. In his dream, he's holding it, making a bunch of money as it makes a small and consistent beeping sound.

> The sound only gets louder...

### Silver Blure

> CALL FROM: Silver Blure

### Miles Prower

> Miles stretches, waking up to the horrible sound of his ringtone. Due to his phone's primitive software, this tone is the same exact tone as his alarm.

> He snatches it off of the coffee table, lying back and taking the call.

### Silver Blure

> "Miles? Hey, uh - hi! Happy December, haha- it's been long! I don't know if you... forgot, but we're dating, y'know?"

### Miles Prower

> "...Silver? Hi? I, uh... didn't forget - I think I might've accidentally, like, went into hibernation, or something..."

### Silver Blure

> "Oh, God, seriously? Miles, you're a member of society, not a wild Mobian. That explains why it's been so long since you last answered."

> "But Miles, I'm calling you now because, well, I'm no longer manager of the burger shop anymore - I got a new job, like... a month ago, and we're having a holiday party. Would you want to join?"

### Miles Prower

> "...Is this the first time you've called me, Silver?"

### Silver Blure

> No? I've called you many times before this. This is the first time you've picked up."

> ...You've missed so much, man. And I miss you. Please, wake up and come to the party. You'll have a good time, alright?"

### Miles Prower

> "Silver, I'm... so sorry- I... I'll come to the party. When, uh... when is--"

### Silver Blure

> "Oh! Uh- You're-- coming? I, uh, sorry, I'm just- it's- hah- it's today at 12. In the afternoon."

### Miles Prower

> "I'll... be sure to make it, alright. I promise you."

### Silver Blure

> "Alright, that's great! I miss you, and I love you dearly- see you soon..."

### Miles Prower

> "...love you too, man. I always will. See ya-"

> Miles hangs up the phone, geting up off of the couch. The first thing he should do is take a shower, but he isn't... too fond of water.

> Ever since the incident, Miles always gets a sting of horrible shame whenever he sees a pool of water, or if water touches him.

> However, he'll have to overcome his fear in order to take a shower.
