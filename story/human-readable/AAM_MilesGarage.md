### Miles Prower

> Miles is in his garage, just trying to make something again, for the first time.

> He had found his old parts bin, from when he was a small boy. It was full of stuff, and slightly charred from the fire, yet still fully intact.

> It was in his garage, from when he moved into this new apartment after his parents' house burnt down. He had tried to salvage everything he could... including his parts bin, which he forgot about years after.

> Thinking about the incident, Miles then thought about his old room... about his old stuff. He had a workshop in his parents' garage. It was so expansive that they had to park outside, in the driveway.

> The whole thing could have been packed up in his parts bin- well, thankfully, most of it was already packed in there, but it required some time to do it from scratch. However, ever since the house burnt down, the only thing left was the stuff that was in his parts bin.

> Miles opened the parts bin, looking at everything inside. There were drills, a box of electronics, sorted well, some screwdrivers, hammers, a small welding kit, and two soldering irons, only one of them having a base station.

> But also... Miles saw an unmarked cardboard box in the corner of the bin. It piqued his interest, having him take it out gently.

> He pushed the bin away from the center of his workspace, putting the box where it was. The box was quite hefty, and shaking it softly suggested there was one big item, plus some other tiny tidbits in there.

> Just then, the garage door began to open up, natural light coming through.

> Behind it was Silver, with a cup of coffee in his right hand, and another positioned in mid-air, looking like it was being controlled with psychokinesis. He was just about to close the keypad that unlocks the garage door, looking at Miles with a smile.

### Miles Prower

> "Oh, it's just you. Hey, Silver." Miles says, his shock dying down.

### Silver Blure

> "Hi, I just thought I'd check on you. Thanks for telling me your garage's code." Silver walks over to Miles and his workspace, looking over everything.

### Miles Prower

> "I, uh, see you got me a coffee?" Miles said as he grabbed the floating cup of coffee out of the air. He drank from it, trying not to burn himself.

> "Ah- it's got some cream in it too. How'd you know?"

### Silver Blure

> "Remember, back when you worked at your old job, every time you clocked in for the morning, you'd come into my office and just start brewing coffee." *Silver laughs a little.* "I couldn't even be mad to be honest, I just thought it was funny you'd bring in your own ground packs as well."

### Miles Prower

> "To be entirely fair, it was the only way I thought I could use them."

### Silver Blure

> "Haha, true. Anyway, what do you have over here?" Silver observes the workspace. The cardboard box even catches his eye as well.

### Miles Prower

> "Oh, it's my old invention stuff." Miles says, putting his focus back on the cardboard box.

### Silver Blure

> "Nooo way! You found it??" Silver exclaims, excitedly. "That's so cool, I can't wait to see what you make! Like that spatula you gave me a couple of years ago!"

### Miles Prower

> Miles' stomach churns at the thought of that spatula. "Uh-huh, the spatula... great example of my work."

> Miles opes up the box, seeing what's inside. It's a yellow, tablet-like device, the name "Miles Electric" printed on the top.

> Miles gasps audibly, grinning because of what he had just found. It's one of the first times he actually... was happy.

> "Oh. Oh wow- I've finally found it... My old Miles Electric. It was in here this whole time!"

### Silver Blure

> "...your... huh? What's a Miles Electric?" Silver asks, obviously confused.

### Miles Prower

> "It was my old digital assistant device." Miles picks up the Miles Electric, trying to turn it on. "It's like... a cool buddy that helps me invent shit."

### ---

> The Miles Electric springs to life, its screen filling with green (and a little bit of orange). It displays the name "Miles Electric" in negative space, eventually booting back to what seems like a home screen.

> This discovery of an old device could definitely change Miles' life for the better... he just doesn't remember much about engineering.

### Silver Blure

> Silver checks out what's happening, seeing all of the fancy stuff Miles had programmed into the Miles Electric. Some of the stuff Silver didn't understand, but there was a clock on the screen, so that was a great starting point. "Woah! That's a lot of stuff I don't understand- Mind filling me in?"

### Miles Prower

> "Well, ehh, this device was really only meant to be understood by me. It is mine, after all. Sorry, dude."

### Silver Blure

> "Ahh, OK! That's fine. Still, that's really cool! When'd you make this?"

### Miles Prower

> "When I was seven. I was quite the nerd back then." Miles says, smirking at his own remark. "I definitely invented a lot of things."

### Silver Blure

> "Wait, when you were *seven*?? Seven?? I'm calling shenanigans."

### Miles Prower

> "That's... fair? I don't believe it myself either. I'm kinda dumb right now. Y'know... I'm getting old."

> Miles sighs, searching through the menus of the Miles Electric. "But I definitely hope I can change my dumbassery. This could absolutely set my career."
