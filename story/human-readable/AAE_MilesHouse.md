# Miles' House
- Silver Blure
- Miles Prower

### Miles Prower

> *zzz...*

> *Miles is rolled over on the floor, due to a mid-sleep fall that he surprisingly didn't wake up from. Silver's sleeping on the bed sideways, like a baby.*

> *Miles slowly gets up... bumping his head on the coffee table.*

> "Ow! damn it-" *He pushes away the coffee table, standing up and looking down at Silver.*

> "...wow, he's really in it for the heavy sleep.*

### Silver Blure

> *Silver was in fact, snoring loudly while sleeping. The sun's in his eyes but literally nothing like that would seem to wake him up.*

### Miles Prower

> *Diz just pats Silver's head, walking over to the kitchen about to eat all of those donuts. He opens the fridge, which is endlessly empty, except for the donut box placed directly in the center. He opens it and grabs two donuts.*

> *He returns to the kitchen, setting a donut on the coffee table and poking Silver.*

> "Yo. Silver. Dude. Wake up."

### Silver Blure

> "mmgh- Miles- whhat is it-?" *Silver mumbles, like he wasn't snoring like hell before. He itches his head, sitting up.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles hands Silver a donut.* "Here you go. You can have it."

### Silver Blure

> "Oh, thank you- but- no thanks... They're for you, y'know. If I wanted a donut, I would have ordered it with the box." *Silver politely declines, and he looks into Miles' eyes. It's obvious he's insisting that Silver takes the donut.*

### Miles Prower

> "Take it. I've been trying to restrain myself from eating too much, so this is for you. Have a donut, dude."

### Silver Blure

> "...I... okay." *Silver takes the donut, taking a nibble.* "...wow, these are good-"

### Miles Prower

> "Aren't they? They're really good." *Miles sits next to Silver, eating his own donut.*

### Silver Blure

> "Yeah- wow- maybe I should have gotten some for myself-" *Silver wolfs down his donut in seconds, laying back on the couch and exhaling.*

### Miles Prower

> "...you ate that fast. Were you trying to hide the donut from somebody?" *Miles teases, poking at Silver.*

### Silver Blure

> "yep. Hiding them from you."

### Miles Prower

> "...y'know, we could just- go to the donut place you got these from. You don't have to eat my donuts." *he says, also laying back soon enough.*

### Silver Blure

> "Yeah, but there's already donuts here-" *Silver whines sarcastically.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles sighs.* "I don't care... at least you give us most of the cut." *Miles stands up, grabbing his wallet off of the coffee table, taking out some money from it.* "Let's go. It shouldn't be too far, right?"

### Silver Blure

> "Mhm! It's only a block away from my house. You know where my house is, right?"

### Miles Prower

> "Uh... nope. I forgot."

### Silver Blure

> "...Oh- OK. Your phone has the directions, right?"

### Miles Prower

> "I don't use... my phone... for navigation, Silver."

### Silver Blure

> "...oh. Well, uh, that's OK! That's fine. I know where my house is."

### Miles Prower

> "Because it's your house?" *Miles sneers.*

### Silver Blure

> "...yeah? That's... whatever-" *Silver paces over to the door, waiting patiently for Miles to get his stuff together.*

### Miles Prower

> *Miles grabs his wallet, keycard, and phone.* "Alright, go on, let's go."

### Silver Blure

> *Silver bursts through the door, Miles in tow. He rushes down the stairs, not waiting for Miles at all.*

### Miles Prower

> *scoff* "Silver, wait up, dumbass-"

    -- Later --

### Miles Prower

> *Miles and Silver return, with two boxes of donuts in each of their arms. Four boxes of donuts, two little dudes who are probably not going to eat them all. Miles sets his box on the counter, while Silver sets his box on the coffee table in the living room.*

### Silver Blure

> "Whew... finally here... I'm so hungry-"

### Miles Prower

> "Hold your horses, Silver... we're not just gonna stuff ourselves with donuts for the entire day..."

### Silver Blure

> "Then why did we get *four boxes..?* I'm pretty sure we're not gonna be able to eat them all before they get stale-"

### Miles Prower

> "Well, maybe I *like* stale donuts, Silver."

### Silver Blure

> "...you do you, then..."

### Miles Prower

> *Later in the day, the two are huddled on the couch, sharing a blanket. They're watching funny stuff on the TV, while the second donut box is open.*

> *Miles grabs a donut from the box, and Silver rips it in half for both of them to share. They've been doing this for the whole hour or two.*

### Silver Blure

> *Silver cuddles tightly with Miles, beginning to doze off.*

### Miles Prower

> "Woah- dude- what are you doing-" *Miles says, a bit shocked by Silver's move.* "You good-? Are... you tired?"

### Silver Blure

> "yeah- sorry."

### Miles Prower

> "N-no, it's OK. It's OK, Silv." *Miles lays back, cuddling with Silver, just like he did himself.*

### Silver Blure

> "...should we close the donut box?" *Silver asks.*

### Miles Prower

> "nah. I like stale donuts~"

### Silver Blure

> "...OK, then... nevermind."

### ---

> *Oh yeah. By the way, they end up dozing off, until next morning.*
