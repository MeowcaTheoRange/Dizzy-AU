> *Miles wakes up to his phone ringing. He stretches, itching his head.* "who the hell..." *He looks to his phone, which displays the name "Silver".*

> "...oh, it's Silver." *Miles sighs, grabbing the phone and picking up the call.*

> "Miles here, what d'ya need?"

### Silver Blure


> "Oh, hi- I was just checking on you since yesterday. You OK?"

### Miles Prower


> "...how much times have you tried to call me?"

### Silver Blure


> "...Ten times."

### Miles Prower


> "ok... well, I just woke up, so calm yourself. I would definitely have called you when I actually woke up. Anyway, I'm fine. You can stop calling..."

### Silver Blure


> "Allright, I will. 'cause at least you picked up. Have a nice day, Miles."

### Miles Prower


> "...I won't forget to..." *Miles hangs up, setting down the phone, sitting up, and rubbing his eyes.*

> *Silver and Miles are sitting at a table, next to each other. They both have vanilla cups with sprinkles and Generic Name Brand Cinnamon Squares atop the mounds of cold. They're having a chat about love and... relationships.*

### Silver Blure


> "So like... how *do* you like being treated in a relationship-?"

### Miles Prower

### Silver Blure


> "Aww... Ditto, Miles. I like you cus you're just so sweet."

### Miles Prower


> "hah- okay, then. love you too, man."

> *Silver and Miles look at each other. Miles gets flustered, looking directly into Silver's eyes. He looks away, blushing profusely. Silver takes notice, chuckling a little as he pats Miles' head.*

### Silver Blure


> *Silver sighs.* "D'ya wanna take this to my house? It's not too far."

### Miles Prower


> "of course it's not too far, you live in the most urban place I know."

### Silver Blure


> "Haha... yeah."

> *They both get up, taking their ice cream with them on the road. They exit the shop, heading almost immediately in the direction of Silver's house.*
